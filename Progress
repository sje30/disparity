Progress on Disparity Program
-----------------------------


* Sat Nov 11 1995

Got the net structure set up and the parameter file in place.  

* Sun Nov 12 1995
Initial weights created at random and can be written out
see file dispwts.c

* Input vectors kind of handled - see dispInputs.c
function getInputVector() gets the nextInputVector.

* Activation of cells calculated calcActivation() in dispnet.c
works in a slowsum or fast method (use slow to check.)

Things to do
------------


* Check number of weights being allocated ok.

* ? How many input vectors per epoch?

* Write the function to determine the value of the merit function V/U

* Calculate errors for each cell.

* Write the derivative function that creates the derivative at a point.


* Diagnostics: ?use gplot to monitor the op values?
